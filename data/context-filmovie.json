As PAK and HOI fall in love they contemplate a possible future together. SUK SUK studies the subtle day-to-day moments of the two men as they struggle between conventional morals and their personal desires.",

The Norwegian artist Lene Marie Fossen (32) is an up and coming, unique talent in the world of photography, facing an international breakthrough. Critics claim she is among the best still photographers in our present time. At the same time she appears to be dying from anorexia. Lene Marie stopped eating when she was ten years old. She didn't want to grow up. Over time the disease has gained control over her body and poisoned her thoughts. The main conflict of the film is the one within Lene Maries's mind, always waging war on itself. Galleries in several countries want to exhibit her art. Lene Maries biggest goal is to have a solo exhibition. Will she be able to travel the world? Can she rid herself of shame by exposing it? The use of Lene Marie's self portraits in this film will offer a unique perspective on the complexity of this illness. The anxiety. Death just a breath away. Raw, naked, honest. Lene Marie has come to a turning point. She has realized that she needs help to control her disease. If not, she will die. Her sensitivity made her ill, but will that also be what saves her?",

The eight members of the Galactic Council, led by Lord Ogmha (William Shatner), meet to discuss the effects of the imminent alignment. They are 8 creators (aliens) and each one of them governs a Planet. They are each responsible for the security and well-being of a 'LENS'. Together they balance the conflict and allegiance of the Universe. Treason puts Earth in danger and the LENS, the hard disc (crystal core) containing the recording of the entire history, DNA, memories and nucleus of mankind is hidden somewhere in Italy. Everyone is searching for it. If the Lens is opened and in the wrong hands it could reveal to the human beings the shocking truth saved in the LENS, that the history of Planet Earth is not really what it seems to be and what their Potentates want humans to believe.",

Foreseeing the upcoming war in Europe, Lithuanian geographer Feliksas Gruodis comes up with an idea to save his country by establishing a Lithuanian colony overseas. The plan is a massive exodus to the so called \"Reserve Lithuania\" in case of occupation. Feliksas tries to sell his idea to one of the most important persons of the state - a grey cardinal of the president, the prime minister Jonas Servus. Dismissing the idea at first, soon the prime minister experiences a heart stroke as the country gets the first signs of war at it's borders. As the president uses his illness to turn him into a scapegoat, the already ex-prime minister gets back to Feliksas, persuades him to reveal his plan and offers his help. The hope to implement the plan doesn't bring much light to Feliksas' personal life. Him and his wife, a childless couple, live in a stiff and cold relationship. As Feliksas finds a fulfilment in his utopia, his wife Veronika finds no way to diminish her loneliness. As Feliksas' political dream comes to realisation, his marriage approaches a collapse. As the country loses the first piece of it's territory, ex-prime minister decides that the only way to implement the plan is to overthrow the president with the help of the military. He invites Feliksas to spend the last night at his home, together with his family. The ideal picture of it makes Feliksas to drop his plan at the last minute and try to save his personal life instead of saving the country.",

It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan \"never kill anyone, not even your enemies\" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film \"Zieja\" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings.",

The journey took over three years, was undertaken on foot accompanied by his young family, and involved immense physical hardship. Once in Darjeeling he built Orgyen Kunsang Chokhorling, a Monastery at 54 Gandhi Road. It was at this address that a handful of single-minded Westerners, in search of a more meaningful life, began to arrive in the late 1960's. Their meeting, although brief (with Rinpoche's passing in 1975), eventually had an extraordinary widespread effect - directly contributing to Buddhism's spread throughout the Western world. Told through the eyes of one of those first Westerners, New Zealander Kim Hegan, as he now, more than 40 years after Rinpoche's passing and his Buddhist practice abandoned, will re-trace the journey he made to Darjeeling 46 years earlier, to tell Rinpoche's profound story, while healing the trauma that kept him away for so long.",

            "description":"\"Jester's night: seriously off nut \" tells us a story that happened the day before - The New Year. It is the time when we wait for the wishes to come true. The picture is about our dreams that change with time and, unfortunately, become more pragmatic. The characters dedicate their lives to the career without noticing anything around them even their lovers' worries. Living this day together with characters, a viewer understands that it is never too late to implement in life their dreams. A businessman and a housewife; a cab driver and a man-hater; a secretary and a barbershop; a director and an ordinary tutor - everyone has their own New Year. For someone it is a pleasant fuss and an opportunity to make a secret wish. For others it is an annual tradition to make fun of oneself and to laugh at others during \"Jester's Night\".",

            "description":"The First World war was a tragedy that launched a series of severe tests for the Russian people: revolution, civil war, famine, political repression, the Second World war. And all this fell on one generation of people. What courage and patience did those people must have had in order to survive all the upheavals of the XXth century? What was their character like? What they must've been thinking and feeling? These questions are asked by the authors of the film \"A Russian Youth\". The film tells the story of a simple village boy who goes to the front of the First World war with a naive youthful dream of fame and medals. In the first battle he loses his sight. He is left to serve as a listener - he must listen carefully through huge metal funnels and raise an alarm in case of enemy airplanes' approach. Back then the basis of the Russian Empire army was wormed of peasants and working class - people with a characteristic appearance, who lived lives of hard physical labor. Many non-professional actors in the film were looking for on the streets, in factories, among the cadets of military schools, in an orphanages - The film features the music by Sergei Rachmaninoff, who created the Third piano Concerto in 1909 op.30. With the power and energy of this piece, the composer predicted the coming upheavals of the XXth century. One can hears Rachmaninoff's premonition about the fate of the people in the lyrical shrill melody. Three decades later, at the beginning of the Second World war, Rachmaninoff will create \"Symphonic dances\" op.45, an even more grand and vigorous work. After which he no longer wrote.",

This isn't an easy task in post-communistic Russia, where an extremely patriarchal culture is ruling, the general perception of being happy equals a life with a successful man and where women outnumber the male population in outright numbers. Our three heroines take matters into hand and start at a course called \"The School of Seduction\", where they learn how to live, think and behave in order to be loved. But is this really what they want and dream about? Director Alina Rudnitskaya, who herself is a Russian woman, have followed her protagonists for seven years, and has remarkable footage of their development, struggling in a country, which always put the man before the woman. In a time where political and cultural reactionary movements are fast-growing all over the world, this is a very relevant and more important story than ever to tell.",
